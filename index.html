            Indian sages and wise men have called knowledge (Vidya) as the means of man’s liberation. Man has desired freedom from fear, hunger, vices, bad tendencies, bad conduct, weakness, poverty and inferiority, disease, grief etc. since time immemorial. The above Mahavakya of Shri Vishnu Puran gives the message that man should strive to get freedom from all his troubles through knowledge. Knowledge is the fruit of sacrifice and penance, hence the attainment of knowledge is always hard work.

              APJ Abdul Kalam Azaad ji once remarked,”Teaching is a very noble profession that shapes the character, caliber and future of an individual. If the people remember me as a good teacher, that will be the biggest honour for me.” Having the same feeling in our hearts,we at Kendriya Vidyalaya,Beholi,Samalkha are putting all our efforts to contribute to our nation’s development.We endeavour to inspire our students to be life-long learners, responsible and sensitized citizens of our country.
